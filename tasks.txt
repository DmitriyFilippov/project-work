Tasks:

1) Create pipeline - automatic model evaluation with multiple different metrics from sckitlearn
2) Try different methodology - different data encoding, different evaluation, different anomaly types, different preprocessing 
3) compare above against each other, recording results
4) Try methodology on real dataset (preprocessed)
5) Summarise methodology and results in Jupyter notebook
